# Problem Statement â€“ 

# An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:

#   -1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
#   -2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
# The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data
